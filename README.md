# Smart Home Project Proposal

## 1. Introduction/ Background

A smart home project involves integrating technology into a home to make daily life simpler, more effective, and more comfortable. It is a creative and intriguing idea. An automated living area that can be fully managed by the owner or occupant via a central hub, a mobile device, or voice commands is the goal of a smart home project. In order to control lighting, temperature, security systems, entertainment systems, and other things in the home, numerous sensors, cameras, and other devices must be installed throughout the house. These devices must be able to communicate with each other and the central hub. Numerous advantages come with a smart home project, such as increased comfort and convenience, cost savings on energy bills, increased security, and personalization to suit the occupants' particular needs and preferences. Smart home projects are an exciting and creative method to increase a house's utility and liveability because the possibilities for building a fully intelligent and automated living space are practically unlimited as technology develops.
